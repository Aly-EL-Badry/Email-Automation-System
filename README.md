# HR Email Classification Automation  

**A Rule-Based Automation System for HR Email Sorting and Workflow Management**

---

## 🚩 Problem  

HR departments receive a continuous stream of emails daily, including job applications, leave requests, payroll inquiries, interview scheduling, employee documentation submissions, and general questions.  

Manually reading, categorizing, and forwarding each email:

- Consumes significant time  
- Creates workflow bottlenecks  
- Increases the risk of delays or misrouting  
- Reduces overall operational efficiency  

As organizations scale, repetitive administrative tasks slow down HR performance and divert attention from higher-value strategic responsibilities. A structured and reliable automation solution becomes essential.

## 💡 Solution  

The **HR Email Classification Automation** project delivers a fully rule-based automation system that automatically sorts, labels, and routes HR-related emails to the appropriate folders or personnel — without relying on machine learning or NLP models.

The system operates using:

- Predefined keyword rules  
- Subject-line matching logic  
- Sender-based filtering  
- Conditional workflow automation  
- Priority tagging rules  

Built using **Python** with email automation protocols (IMAP/SMTP), the system continuously monitors the inbox, applies classification rules, and triggers automated actions such as:

- Forwarding emails to the correct department  
- Assigning labels or folders  
- Generating structured auto-responses  
- Flagging urgent messages
